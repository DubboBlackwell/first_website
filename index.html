        <h1>First Website!</h1>
            <p>This is my first ever HTML website! My name is David. Thank you for peeking in to my very first project.</p>
            <p>This project is an attempt to <em><b>properly</b></em> display my understanding on the usage of <strong>BOLD TEXT</strong>,
                <em>Italics or Emphasized words,</em> and <b>Headings.</b></p>
        
        <h2>Why programming?</h2>
            <p>I have always been interested in code since I was in high school back in the early 2000s. I have no <em>formal</em> education when it comes
            to coding but I have <strong>dabbled</strong> in programming before by ways of a private Ragnarok Online server.</p> 
            <p>My main duties were to write code in C++ for <em>NPC functions</em> but quickly had to switch priorities as we were preparing for our second child.</p>
        
        <h2>Why now?</h2>
            <p>I think the more fitting question is <em><strong>why not earlier?</strong></em> I have been an ESL tutor since 2013 and as much as 
            I <strong>enjoy</strong> the education industry, it is simply put, <strong><em>linear</em></strong>, with little to no growth opportunities.</p>
